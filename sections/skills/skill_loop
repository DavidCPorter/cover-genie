I designed and co-developed a Ruby on Rails web application and led the migration to an enterprise API product. Led infrastructure and security operations with AWS.
I conceptualized, designed, and implemented a DevOps framework for orchestrating multi-architectural evaluations of cloud-native service architectures.
I deployed and configured JVM applications and benchmarked their performance with custom distributed load-generation applications as part of my PhD work.
I have worked with the full scope of Ansible, which strengthened my background for building and deploying large-scale applications across platforms.
