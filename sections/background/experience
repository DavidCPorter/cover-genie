I have relevant experience with both frontend (designing and implementing DevOps CLI tooling and JavaScript data visualizations) and backend technology (Java, Rails, Node, Ansible, Bash, Python).
I have worked with several cloud platforms including AWS, GCP, and CloudLab for provisioning compute and storage throughout the process of my PhD studies.
I've developed CI/CD systems with Jenkins2 and performed many Black/White Box testing across cloud-native systems during my time in the PhD program and TA'ing courses e.g. Cloud Data Center Systems.
You can see some of my work tuning search engines and evaluating the tradeoffs with my project SAPA, linked in my resume.
