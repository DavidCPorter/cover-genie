I have relevant experience with both frontend (designing and implementing DevOps CLI tooling and JavaScript data visualizations) and backend technology (Java, Rails, Node, Ansible, Bash, Python).
I have worked with several cloud platforms including AWS, GCP, and CloudLab for provisioning compute and storage throughout the process of my PhD studies.
